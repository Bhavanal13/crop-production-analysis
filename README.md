# Agricultural Practices Across European Countries  
### Ensuring Food Security in a Changing Climate  

## Project Description  
This project explores agricultural practices and crop production trends across European countries, with the goal of understanding how climate variability impacts food security.  
It combines **data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning models** to extract insights from agricultural datasets.  

The project was developed as part of my Data Science coursework at **TU Darmstadt**.  


## Objectives  
- Analyze crop production data from European countries.  
- Identify trends and patterns in agricultural output.  
- Apply statistical tests to compare yields across regions.  
- Build predictive models to forecast crop production.  
- Highlight the most influential factors affecting yields.  


## Technologies & Libraries  
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Data Handling:** pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, biokit  
- **Statistics:** scipy (ANOVA, t-tests, Leveneâ€™s test, normality tests)  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression)
